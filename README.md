- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabe Corsini 
- 👀 I’m interested interested in Software Development in C#, Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365, Cyber Security, and automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in C# and anything to do with Azure.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects in the C# programming languages that could use a beginners touch. 
- 📫 I can be reached at gabe@corsini.tech
